# Linked Lists

Arrays already exist in basic C so I've skipped them.

Unlike Arrays linked lists don't use contiguous memory addresses. Instead they use pointers to point to the next item in the array. There are multiple variants of linked lists including circular linked lists, and doubly linked lists.

Linked lists perform better under insertion and deletion in O(1) time but worse under read O(n) time to traverse the list
